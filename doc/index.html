                In its first release, Waiting4Godot (W4G) is an UML modeling tool designed 
                with the purpose of producing business analyzes of software systems 
                that are intuitive to make and agree upon, yet flexible to accommodate different approaches.

                The tool's name reflects the spirit of its author at the time of authoring.
                The author is a Sudanese citizen living in his country since 2020. The time of 
                authoring is early 2023, 4 years after the country's third successful popular
                uprising & almost a year and a half after its fourth (successful) coup d'etat.
